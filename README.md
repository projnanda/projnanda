## üöÄ Project NANDA

**Project NANDA** is building the foundational infrastructure for the **Open Agentic Web** - a system where trillions of AI agents can collaborate, communicate, and transact across organizational boundaries without bottlenecks or security vulnerabilities. NANDA addresses the core challenge: how can billions or even trillions of AI agents discover each other, verify capabilities, and coordinate tasks without creating bottlenecks or security vulnerabilities. The project develops both the technical infrastructure (index, protocols, SDKs) and the governance frameworks needed for a responsible, **Open Agentic Web**.
Created at MIT, NANDA provides the **index**, **protocols**, and **tools** needed to enable this decentralized, protocol-neutral ecosystem. 

### üéØ The Vision
We're moving from:
- **Static content** ‚Üí **Dynamic services** ‚Üí **Autonomous actors**
- AI models that just generate content ‚Üí AI that **carries out actions** on our behalf
- Siloed systems ‚Üí **Open, interoperable agent networks**

## üîß Technical Deep Dive

### Why Not DNS?

DNS was designed in 1983 for static web infrastructure. Here's why it falls short for AI agents:

| Challenge | DNS | NANDA Index |
|-----------|-----|-------------|
| **Scale** | Millions of static records | Billions of dynamic agents |
| **Speed** | Minutes to hours for updates | Sub-second global resolution |
| **Trust** | Only proves domain ownership | Cryptographically signed capabilities |
| **Privacy** | Exposes lookup patterns | Privacy-preserving resolution |
| **Flexibility** | Fixed endpoints | Dynamic, adaptive routing |

### The "Quilt" Architecture

NANDA supports multiple registration types in a federated "quilt":

```
@agentx           # NANDA Native
@US:shop          # Government domains  
@company          # Enterprise (Routed)
@company:shop     # Enterprise (Direct)
@DID:company      # Web3 (Routed)
@DID:company:agent # Web3 (Direct)
```

### Protocol Interoperability

NANDA bridges protocols seamlessly:
- **MCP** (Model Context Protocol)
- **A2A** (Agent-to-Agent Protocol)  
- **HTTPS** (Traditional web)
- **NLWeb** (Microsoft's natural language interfaces)

## üåç Our Belief

The web will evolve from static content to dynamic services to autonomous actors. AI models will not just generate content but carry out actions on our behalf. Registries and protocols must be open to prevent capture and enable global participation.

**Join us in building the next layer of the web.**
