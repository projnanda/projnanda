## Project NANDA

**Project NANDA** is building the foundational infrastructure for the **Open Agentic Web** - a system where trillions of AI agents can collaborate, communicate, and transact across organizational boundaries without bottlenecks or security vulnerabilities. NANDA addresses the core challenge: how can billions or even trillions of AI agents discover each other, verify capabilities, and coordinate tasks without creating bottlenecks or security vulnerabilities. The project develops both the technical infrastructure (index - interop links between all heterogenous agent registries, protocols, SDKs) and the governance frameworks needed for a responsible, **Open Agentic Web**.

#### Project NANDA‚Äôs Three Phases

Phase 1. Agentic Web Foundations ‚Äì Neutral, Open and Distributed core rails for agent onboarding, discovery üîç, and trusted indexing üìá across heterogenous industrywide implementations.

Phase 2. Agentic Commerce ‚Äì Market infrastructure for knowledge pricing üí° and decentralized, edge-native AI services.

Phase 3. Agent Society ‚Äì Large-population models that power co-learning and collaboration across data silos.

Created at MIT, NANDA provides the **index**, **protocols**, and **tools** needed to enable this decentralized, protocol-neutral ecosystem.

Introduces the AgentFacts schema, TTL-based endpoint resolution, and cryptographic verification for agent capabilities. Offers concrete mechanisms for multi-endpoint routing, least-disclosure queries, and rapid revocation in decentralized agent ecosystems.

**[Upgrade or Switch ‚Äì The Need for New Registry](v0.3%20Upgrade%20or%20Switch%20-%20Do%20We%20Need%20a%20New%20Registry%20Architecture%20for%20the%20Internet%20of%20AI%20Agents.pdf)** - Analyzes the limitations of DNS and web infrastructure for AI agent systems. Weighs incremental upgrades (e.g., DNS push, SVCB records) against purpose-built registries. Offers analogies like dial-up to broadband and outlines the technical deltas introduced by the agent paradigm.

##  Our Belief

The web will evolve from static content to dynamic services to autonomous actors. AI models will not just generate content but carry out actions on our behalf. Registries and protocols must be open to prevent capture and enable global participation.

**Join us in building the next layer of the web.**
