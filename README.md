## What is Project NANDA?

**​​​Project NANDA** (Networked AI Agents in Decentralized Architecture) which originated at MIT aims to dismantle the four critical choke points within this ecosystem's infrastructure by focusing on consensus driven innovation: 'DNS', 'CA', 'Orchestration', and 'Attestation'.

**​​​Project NANDA** is pioneering the foundational infrastructure for the Internet of AI Agents — enabling autonomous systems to interact, transact, and collaborate seamlessly.

​​​**​​​Project NANDA**  employs a three-pronged approach: 

  (i) Technology: Building technology, standards, and reference implementations through a collective of top minds. 
  
  (ii) Social Mission: Working to maintain an open Agentic Web for innovators while ensuring safety for vulnerable populations. 
  
  (iii) Venture Ecosystem: Fostering a wide coalition of founders and investors.

Project ​​​​NANDA's development draws on proven MIT research in AutoML, split learning, privacy-preserving architectures, and decentralized coordination. Early partners in the coalition gain preferential access to emerging standards, reference implementations, and the academic-industry consortium that will influence the emerging frameworks globally.
