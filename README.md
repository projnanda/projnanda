## Project NANDA

**Project NANDA** is building the foundational infrastructure for the **Open Agentic Web** - a system where trillions of AI agents can collaborate, communicate, and transact across organizational boundaries without bottlenecks or security vulnerabilities. NANDA addresses the core challenge: how can billions or even trillions of AI agents discover each other, verify capabilities, and coordinate tasks without creating bottlenecks or security vulnerabilities. The project develops both the technical infrastructure (index - interop links between all heterogenous agent registries, protocols, SDKs) and the governance frameworks needed for a responsible, **Open Agentic Web**.

NANDA provides the **index**, **protocols**, and **tools** needed to enable this decentralized, protocol-neutral ecosystem.

##  Development Roadmap

### Phase 1: Foundations of Agentic Web 
**Foundation/Onboarding/Index**
- Index Infrastructure: NANDA Index for agent discovery and identity
- Cross-Platform Communication: Protocol bridges between A2A, MCP, HTTPS
- Agent Onboarding: SDKs and tools for easy agent deployment
- Interoperability: Standards for agents to work across different platforms

### Phase 2: Agentic Commerce 
**Knowledge pricing, edge AI**
- Knowledge Pricing: Mechanisms for agents to value and exchange information
- Edge AI Integration: Distributed intelligence at network edges

##  Research & Publications

Our research papers outline the architectural, strategic, and technical foundations:

###  Latest Research Papers

 **[Beyond DNS: Unlocking the Internet of AI Agents via the NANDA Index, Verified AgentFacts and Adaptive Resolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14263)** - Details the design of a minimal, privacy-preserving registry architecture for agent discovery. Introduces the AgentFacts schema, TTL-based endpoint resolution, and cryptographic verification for agent capabilities. Offers concrete mechanisms for multi-endpoint routing, least-disclosure queries, and rapid revocation in decentralized agent ecosystems. [![arXiv](https://img.shields.io/badge/arXiv-2507.14263-00ff00.svg)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14263)

**[Upgrade or Switch – The Need for New Registry](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12003)** - Analyzes the limitations of DNS and web infrastructure for AI agent systems. Weighs incremental upgrades (e.g., DNS push, SVCB records) against purpose-built registries. Offers analogies like dial-up to broadband and outlines the technical deltas introduced by the agent paradigm.

**[NANDA Adaptive Resolver: Architecture for Dynamic Resolution of AI Agent Names](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03113)** - AdaptiveResolver is a dynamic microservice architecture designed to address the limitations of static endpoint resolution for AI agent communication in distributed, heterogeneous environments. [![arXiv](https://img.shields.io/badge/arXiv-2508.03113-00ff00.svg)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03113)    


**[Using the NANDA Index Architecture in Practice: An Enterprise Perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03101)** - Presents the NANDA framework for secure AI agent ecosystems and cross-protocol interoperability, and explores enterprise use cases. Introduces Zero Trust Agentic Access (ZTAA) and Agent Visibility & Control (AVC) for enterprise governance of autonomous agent collaboration.  [![arXiv](https://img.shields.io/badge/arXiv-2508.03101-00ff00.svg)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03101)

**[Survey of AI Agent Registry Solutions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03095)** - Compares leading registry architectures - MCP, A2A, Microsoft Entra Agent ID, and NANDA, across security, scalability, authentication, and maintainability. Highlights NANDA’s AgentFacts as a privacy-preserving, cryptographically verifiable schema purpose-built for dynamic, multi-agent systems.

##  Our Belief

The web will evolve from static content to dynamic services to autonomous actors. AI models will not just generate content but carry out actions on our behalf. Registries and protocols must be open to prevent capture and enable global participation.

**Join us in building the next layer of the web.**
