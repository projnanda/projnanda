## 🚀 Project NANDA

**Project NANDA** is building the foundational infrastructure for the **Open Agentic Web** - a system where trillions of AI agents can collaborate, communicate, and transact across organizational boundaries without bottlenecks or security vulnerabilities. NANDA addresses the core challenge: how can billions or even trillions of AI agents discover each other, verify capabilities, and coordinate tasks without creating bottlenecks or security vulnerabilities. The project develops both the technical infrastructure (index - interop links between all heterogenous agent registries, protocols, SDKs) and the governance frameworks needed for a responsible, **Open Agentic Web**.

#### Project NANDA’s Three Pillars

🌐 Agentic Web Foundations – Neutral, Open and Distributed core rails for agent onboarding, discovery 🔍, and trusted indexing 📇 across heterogenous industrywide implementations.

💱🤖 Agentic Commerce – Market infrastructure for knowledge pricing 💡 and decentralized, edge-native AI services.

🧑‍🤝‍🧑📚 Agent Society – Large-population models that power co-learning and collaboration across data silos.

Created at MIT, NANDA provides the **index**, **protocols**, and **tools** needed to enable this decentralized, protocol-neutral ecosystem. 

### 🎯 The Vision
We're moving from:
- **Static content** → **Dynamic services** → **Autonomous actors**
- AI models that just generate content → AI that **carries out actions** on our behalf
- Siloed systems → **Open, interoperable agent networks**

## 🏗️ NANDA Index Architecture Overview
The NANDA Index is the foundational component of Project NANDA's three-stage vision for building the Internet of AI Agents. Using a city analogy: if A2A protocols are the streets agents use to communicate, Project NANDA builds the entire city, and the NANDA Index serves as the address system.

#### To put NANDA Index in the context of bigger vision Project NANDA, which progresses through three technical phases:

Phase 1 - Foundations of Agentic Web: NANDA Index provides agent identity and discovery infrastructure, plus cross-platform communication protocols and interoperability standards

Phase 2 - Agentic Commerce: Knowledge pricing mechanisms, edge AI integration, economic protocols, and resource markets for agent services

Phase 3 - Society of Agents: Large Population Models (LPMs), collaborative learning systems, cross-silo coordination, and distributed AI networks

The NANDA Index enables all three stages by providing the essential discovery infrastructure that lets agents find and identify each other across the ecosystem. Howeever, it is only one part of the bigger goal of Project NANDA.

The NANDA Index is a lightweight, decentralized system that functions as the "phone book" for the Internet of AI Agents. Just as DNS maps website names to IP addresses, the NANDA Index maps agent names to their locations and capabilities, enabling billions of AI agents to discover and connect with each other across different platforms and protocols.

Think of it as a universal directory where any AI agent—whether it's a translation assistant, a financial advisor, or a healthcare coordinator—can register itself and be found by other agents or users who need its services.

NANDA Index is intentionally modular and protocol-agnostic, stitching together existing and emerging protocols through open registries and SDKs.

## 🔧 Technical Deep Dive

### Why Not DNS?

DNS was designed in 1983 for static web infrastructure. Here's why it falls short for AI agents:

| Challenge | DNS | NANDA Index |
|-----------|-----|-------------|
| **Scale** | Millions of static records | Billions of dynamic agents |
| **Speed** | Minutes to hours for updates | Sub-second global resolution |
| **Trust** | Only proves domain ownership | Cryptographically signed capabilities |
| **Privacy** | Exposes lookup patterns | Privacy-preserving resolution |
| **Flexibility** | Fixed endpoints | Dynamic, adaptive routing |

### The "Quilt" Architecture

NANDA supports multiple registration types in a federated "quilt":

```
@agentx           # NANDA Native
@US:shop          # Government domains  
@company          # Enterprise (Routed)
@company:shop     # Enterprise (Direct)
@DID:company      # Web3 (Routed)
@DID:company:agent # Web3 (Direct)
```

### Protocol Interoperability

NANDA bridges protocols seamlessly:
- **MCP** (Model Context Protocol)
- **A2A** (Agent-to-Agent Protocol)  
- **HTTPS** (Traditional web)
- **NLWeb** (Microsoft's natural language interfaces)

## 🌍 Our Belief

The web will evolve from static content to dynamic services to autonomous actors. AI models will not just generate content but carry out actions on our behalf. Registries and protocols must be open to prevent capture and enable global participation.

**Join us in building the next layer of the web.**
