# ADR-001: Enterprise Security Framework for NANDA Internet of Agents

## Status

**Status**: Proposed  
**Date**: 2025-01-20  
**Author**: Security Team (parmarmanojkumar)  
**Reviewers**: TBD  

## Context

The NANDA project is building infrastructure for the Internet of AI Agents, enabling trillions of AI agents to collaborate across organizational boundaries. This creates unprecedented security and privacy challenges that require enterprise-grade security controls beyond traditional web application security.

### Current State

NANDA currently implements:
- Cryptographic verification via AgentFacts
- Privacy-preserving registry architecture with minimal data exposure
- Zero Trust Agentic Access (ZTAA) conceptual framework
- Cross-protocol interoperability with basic security isolation

### Security Challenges

1. **Scale**: Billions to trillions of agents requiring rapid discovery and verification
2. **Trust**: Cross-organizational agent interactions without centralized authority
3. **Privacy**: Maintaining anonymity while ensuring accountability
4. **Interoperability**: Secure communication across heterogeneous agent protocols
5. **Supply Chain**: Verifying integrity of distributed agent packages and capabilities

### Compliance Requirements

- OWASP ASVS Level 2 minimum (Level 3 for sensitive applications)
- GDPR compliance for EU operations
- SOC2 Type II for enterprise adoption
- NIST Cybersecurity Framework alignment

## Decision

We will implement a comprehensive Enterprise Security Framework for NANDA with the following architecture:

### Security Architecture Stack

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│        Agent Application Layer          │
│     (Business Logic, Agent Services)    │
├─────────────────────────────────────────┤
│     Security Policy Enforcement        │
│   (RBAC, Rate Limiting, Validation)    │
├─────────────────────────────────────────┤
│       Identity & Access Layer          │
│    (OIDC, 2FA, Session Management)     │
├─────────────────────────────────────────┤
│        Network Security Layer          │
│     (TLS 1.3, mTLS, Firewalling)      │
├─────────────────────────────────────────┤
│       Infrastructure Layer             │
│  (Container Security, HSM, Monitoring) │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Core Security Components

#### 1. Authentication & Authorization
- **OIDC/OAuth2** for agent authentication
- **Multi-Factor Authentication** for administrative access
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** with principle of least privilege
- **JSON Web Tokens (JWT)** with proper expiration and rotation

#### 2. Cryptographic Security
- **TLS 1.3 minimum** for all communications
- **AES-256 encryption** for data at rest
- **EdDSA signatures** for agent capability verification
- **Hardware Security Modules (HSM)** for key management

#### 3. Input Validation & Sanitization
- **Whitelist-based validation** for all inputs
- **Parameterized queries only** (no dynamic SQL)
- **Content Security Policy (CSP)** for web interfaces
- **Rate limiting** and DDoS protection

#### 4. Supply Chain Security
- **Software Bill of Materials (SBOM)** for all agent packages
- **Cryptographic signing** of agent artifacts
- **Dependency vulnerability scanning** in CI/CD
- **Provenance tracking** for agent capabilities

#### 5. Privacy Protection
- **Data minimization** with ≤120 byte index records
- **Zero-knowledge proofs** for capability verification
- **Differential privacy** for analytics
- **Anonymous resolution paths** to prevent surveillance

#### 6. Monitoring & Incident Response
- **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)**
- **Real-time threat detection** and behavioral analysis
- **Automated incident response** with playbooks
- **Security metrics** and compliance reporting

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Critical Security Foundation (0-3 months)
- [ ] Implement OIDC authentication for registry access
- [ ] Add TLS 1.3 enforcement for all communications
- [ ] Create input validation framework
- [ ] Set up automated security scanning in CI/CD
- [ ] Establish vulnerability disclosure process

### Phase 2: Enterprise Security Integration (3-6 months)
- [ ] Deploy SIEM and security monitoring
- [ ] Implement zero trust network architecture
- [ ] Add cryptographic signing for agent packages
- [ ] Create RBAC framework for agent management
- [ ] Begin SOC2 compliance preparation

### Phase 3: Advanced Security & Privacy (6-12 months)
- [ ] Integrate privacy-enhancing technologies
- [ ] Add AI-specific security controls (adversarial attack protection)
- [ ] Complete third-party security audit
- [ ] Achieve security certifications
- [ ] Implement advanced threat detection

## Rationale

### Why This Approach

1. **Layered Defense**: Multiple security layers provide defense in depth
2. **Standards Alignment**: Follows established security frameworks (OWASP, NIST)
3. **Privacy by Design**: Maintains NANDA's privacy-preserving principles
4. **Scalability**: Architecture scales to billions of agents
5. **Interoperability**: Works across different agent protocols and platforms

### Alternative Approaches Considered

1. **Platform-Specific Security**: Rejected due to lack of interoperability
2. **Blockchain-Only Security**: Rejected due to scalability and energy concerns
3. **Minimal Security**: Rejected due to enterprise adoption requirements
4. **Centralized PKI**: Rejected due to single point of failure and control

### Trade-offs

#### Pros
- Enterprise-ready security posture
- Compliance with major regulatory frameworks
- Privacy-preserving while ensuring accountability
- Scalable to Internet-scale agent interactions

#### Cons
- Increased complexity in implementation
- Higher infrastructure costs for security controls
- Potential performance impact from security checks
- Learning curve for developers new to enterprise security

## Consequences

### Positive Impacts
- Enables enterprise adoption of NANDA infrastructure
- Provides strong privacy protection for users
- Establishes trust in cross-organizational agent interactions
- Creates sustainable security governance model

### Risks and Mitigations
- **Complexity Risk**: Mitigate with comprehensive documentation and training
- **Performance Risk**: Mitigate with optimized security controls and caching
- **Cost Risk**: Mitigate with phased implementation and open-source tools
- **Adoption Risk**: Mitigate with backward compatibility and migration tools

### Technical Debt
