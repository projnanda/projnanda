# ADR-001: Enterprise Security Framework for NANDA Internet of Agents

## Status

**Status**: Proposed  
**Date**: 2025-01-20  
**Author**: Security Team (parmarmanojkumar)  
**Reviewers**: TBD  

## Context

The NANDA project is building infrastructure for the Internet of AI Agents, enabling trillions of AI agents to collaborate across organizational boundaries. Based on comprehensive security assessments of all three core components using advanced AI security frameworks (OWASP LLM/Agentic AI, MITRE ATLAS, MAESTRO), this creates unprecedented security and privacy challenges that require immediate and comprehensive enterprise-grade security controls.

### Component Security Assessment Results

**Critical Findings from Component Analysis:**

| Component | Security Level | Critical Issues | Risk Level |
|-----------|----------------|-----------------|------------|
| **NANDA-INDEX** | **0/5** | No authentication, DB injection | **CRITICAL** |
| **NANDA-AGENT** | **1/5** | Prompt injection, hardcoded secrets | **CRITICAL** |
| **NANDA-ADAPTER** | **2/5** | Unsandboxed frameworks | **HIGH** |

### AI Security Framework Assessment

**Applied Advanced Security Frameworks:**
- **OWASP Top 10 for LLM Applications**: Critical vulnerabilities across all components
- **OWASP Top 10 for Agentic AI**: Multi-agent security gaps identified
- **MITRE ATLAS Framework**: ML-specific attack vectors detected
- **MAESTRO Framework**: Multi-agent orchestration vulnerabilities found

### Current State

NANDA currently implements:
- Cryptographic verification via AgentFacts
- Privacy-preserving registry architecture with minimal data exposure
- Zero Trust Agentic Access (ZTAA) conceptual framework
- Cross-protocol interoperability with basic security isolation

### Security Challenges

1. **Scale**: Billions to trillions of agents requiring rapid discovery and verification
2. **Trust**: Cross-organizational agent interactions without centralized authority
3. **Privacy**: Maintaining anonymity while ensuring accountability
4. **Interoperability**: Secure communication across heterogeneous agent protocols
5. **Supply Chain**: Verifying integrity of distributed agent packages and capabilities

### Compliance Requirements

- OWASP ASVS Level 2 minimum (Level 3 for sensitive applications)
- GDPR compliance for EU operations
- SOC2 Type II for enterprise adoption
- NIST Cybersecurity Framework alignment

## Decision

We will implement a comprehensive Enterprise Security Framework for NANDA with the following architecture:

### Security Architecture Stack

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│        Agent Application Layer          │
│     (Business Logic, Agent Services)    │
├─────────────────────────────────────────┤
│     Security Policy Enforcement        │
│   (RBAC, Rate Limiting, Validation)    │
├─────────────────────────────────────────┤
│       Identity & Access Layer          │
│    (OIDC, 2FA, Session Management)     │
├─────────────────────────────────────────┤
│        Network Security Layer          │
│     (TLS 1.3, mTLS, Firewalling)      │
├─────────────────────────────────────────┤
│       Infrastructure Layer             │
│  (Container Security, HSM, Monitoring) │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Core Security Components

#### 1. Authentication & Authorization

- **AES-256 encryption** for data at rest
- **EdDSA signatures** for agent capability verification
- **Hardware Security Modules (HSM)** for key management

#### 3. Input Validation & Sanitization
- **Whitelist-based validation** for all inputs
- **Parameterized queries only** (no dynamic SQL)
- **Content Security Policy (CSP)** for web interfaces
- **Rate limiting** and DDoS protection

#### 4. Supply Chain Security
- **Software Bill of Materials (SBOM)** for all agent packages
- **Cryptographic signing** of agent artifacts
- **Dependency vulnerability scanning** in CI/CD
- **Provenance tracking** for agent capabilities

#### 5. Privacy Protection
- **Data minimization** with ≤120 byte index records
- **Zero-knowledge proofs** for capability verification
- **Differential privacy** for analytics
- **Anonymous resolution paths** to prevent surveillance

#### 6. Monitoring & Incident Response
- **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)**
- **Real-time threat detection** and behavioral analysis
- **Automated incident response** with playbooks
- **Security metrics** and compliance reporting

## Implementation Phases

**Note**: This ADR defines the security architecture and framework. For detailed implementation plans, timelines, and resource requirements, see [SECURITY_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md](../security-analysis/SECURITY_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md).

## Rationale

### Why This Approach

1. **Layered Defense**: Multiple security layers provide defense in depth
2. **Standards Alignment**: Follows established security frameworks (OWASP, NIST)
3. **Privacy by Design**: Maintains NANDA's privacy-preserving principles
4. **Scalability**: Architecture scales to billions of agents
5. **Interoperability**: Works across different agent protocols and platforms

### Alternative Approaches Considered

1. **Platform-Specific Security**: Rejected due to lack of interoperability
2. **Blockchain-Only Security**: Rejected due to scalability and energy concerns
3. **Minimal Security**: Rejected due to enterprise adoption requirements
4. **Centralized PKI**: Rejected due to single point of failure and control

### Trade-offs
