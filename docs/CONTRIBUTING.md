Welcome to Project NANDA! We're building the foundational infrastructure for the Internet of AI Agents, and we welcome contributions from the community. This document outlines how to contribute effectively and securely to the project.

## Code of Conduct

Project NANDA is committed to providing a welcoming and inclusive environment for all contributors. By participating, you agree to abide by our community standards of respect, collaboration, and constructive dialogue.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Git knowledge and GitHub account
- Understanding of AI agent architectures and distributed systems
- Familiarity with security best practices
- Commitment to privacy-preserving design principles

### Development Environment Setup

1. **Fork and Clone**
   ```bash
   git fork https://github.com/projnanda/projnanda.git
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/projnanda.git
   cd projnanda
   ```

2. **Set Up Development Branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b dev
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install  # or appropriate package manager
   ```

4. **Run Security Checks**
   ```bash
   make security-check
   npm audit --audit-level high
   ```

## Development Workflow

### Branching Strategy

We follow the GitFlow model with security enhancements:

- **main**: Production-ready code, protected branch
- **dev**: Development integration branch  
- **feature/**: New features (branch from dev)
- **bugfix/**: Bug fixes (branch from dev)
- **hotfix/**: Critical production fixes (branch from main)
- **security/**: Security fixes (high priority, expedited review)

### Branch Naming Convention

```
feature/TICKET-ID-short-description
bugfix/TICKET-ID-short-description
security/CVE-or-ID-short-description
docs/section-update-type
```

Examples:
- `feature/SEC-123-oauth2-authentication`
- `bugfix/REG-456-agent-discovery-timeout`
- `security/CVE-2024-001-input-validation`
