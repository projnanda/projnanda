# Security Policy

## Project NANDA Security Framework

Project NANDA is committed to building secure infrastructure for the Internet of AI Agents. This document outlines our security policies, vulnerability reporting procedures, and security best practices for contributors.

## Supported Versions

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| Latest  | :white_check_mark: |
| < 1.0   | :x:                |

## Security Principles

NANDA follows security-by-design principles:

- **Zero Trust Architecture**: Deny by default, verify everything
- **Privacy by Design**: Minimal data exposure, anonymous resolution
- **Cryptographic Verification**: All agent capabilities cryptographically signed
- **Supply Chain Security**: SBOM required, artifacts signed and verified
- **Continuous Monitoring**: Real-time security monitoring and alerting

## Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

### ðŸš¨ DO NOT REPORT SECURITY ISSUES IN PUBLIC ISSUES

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it privately to protect users while we develop a fix.

### How to Report

**Email**: security@projectnanda.org  
**PGP Key**: [Available on request]  
**Response Time**: 72 hours maximum

### What to Include

1. **Description** of the vulnerability
2. **Steps to reproduce** the issue
3. **Affected versions** or components
4. **Potential impact** assessment
5. **Suggested mitigation** (if available)

### Our Response Process

1. **Acknowledgment**: Within 72 hours
2. **Initial Assessment**: Within 5 business days
3. **Fix Development**: Timeline provided based on severity
4. **Security Advisory**: Published after fix deployment
5. **Recognition**: Security researchers credited (if desired)

## Security Requirements for Contributors

### Code Contributions

All code contributions must:

- [ ] Pass automated security scanning (SAST/SCA)
- [ ] Include input validation for all user inputs
- [ ] Use parameterized queries only (no dynamic SQL)
- [ ] Follow secure coding practices per OWASP guidelines
- [ ] Include security test cases where applicable

### Agent Development

Agents registered with NANDA must:

- [ ] Implement TLS 1.3 for all communications
- [ ] Use cryptographic signatures for capability verification
- [ ] Follow privacy-preserving data handling practices
- [ ] Provide Software Bill of Materials (SBOM)
- [ ] Sign all distributed artifacts

### Security Review Requirements

- **All PRs**: Automated security scanning required
- **Security-sensitive changes**: Manual security review by Security Champion
- **Architecture changes**: Security design review with threat modeling
- **Third-party integrations**: Security assessment and approval

## Security Controls

### Authentication & Authorization

- **Agent Authentication**: OIDC/OAuth2 required for sensitive operations
- **Multi-Factor Authentication**: Required for administrative access
- **Session Management**: Secure cookies, proper timeouts
- **API Security**: Rate limiting, input validation, proper error handling

### Data Protection

- **Encryption in Transit**: TLS 1.3 minimum for all communications
- **Encryption at Rest**: AES-256 for stored data
- **Key Management**: HSM/KMS for cryptographic keys
- **Data Classification**: PII, sensitive data properly classified and handled

### Infrastructure Security

- **Container Security**: Non-root execution, minimal attack surface
- **Network Segmentation**: Microsegmentation for agent communications
- **Monitoring**: SIEM for security event detection and response
- **Vulnerability Management**: Regular scanning and patching

## Privacy Protection

### Data Minimization

- Index records limited to â‰¤120 bytes
- Only essential information stored in central registry
- Detailed metadata distributed via AgentFacts

### Privacy-Preserving Features

- Anonymous agent discovery mechanisms
- Privacy-preserving resolution paths
- Zero-knowledge proofs for capability verification
- Federated architecture preventing surveillance

### Compliance

- **GDPR**: Privacy by design, data minimization, right to erasure
- **CCPA**: Consumer privacy rights and transparency
- **SOC2**: Security, availability, processing integrity

## Incident Response

### Security Incident Classification

- **P0 - Critical**: Active exploitation, data breach, service compromise
- **P1 - High**: Unpatched critical vulnerabilities, potential data exposure
- **P2 - Medium**: Security policy violations, misconfigurations
- **P3 - Low**: Best practice improvements, security hardening

### Response Timeline

- **P0**: Immediate response, 4-hour resolution target
- **P1**: 24-hour response, 72-hour resolution target
- **P2**: 72-hour response, 1-week resolution target
- **P3**: 1-week response, scheduled resolution

### Communication

Security incidents are communicated via:

- Internal security alerts (immediate)
- Community security advisories (post-resolution)
- Public disclosure (90 days post-fix or sooner if appropriate)

## Security Training

### Required Training

All contributors must complete:

- Secure coding practices training
- OWASP Top 10 awareness
- Privacy and data protection training
- Incident response procedures

### Resources

- [OWASP Web Application Security Testing Guide](https://owasp.org/www-project-web-security-testing-guide/)
- [NIST Cybersecurity Framework](https://www.nist.gov/cyberframework)
- [CIS Controls](https://www.cisecurity.org/controls)

## Security Tools and Automation

### Required Security Scanning

- **SAST**: Static Application Security Testing
- **SCA**: Software Composition Analysis
- **IaC Scanning**: Infrastructure as Code security validation
- **Secret Scanning**: Prevention of credential exposure

### CI/CD Security Gates

All builds must pass:
- Security linting and formatting
- Vulnerability scanning (no High/Critical findings)
- SBOM generation and artifact signing
- Security test execution
