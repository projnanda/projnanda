###  Latest Research Papers

 **[Beyond DNS: Unlocking the Internet of AI Agents via the NANDA Index, Verified AgentFacts and Adaptive Resolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14263)** - Details the design of a minimal, privacy-preserving registry architecture for agent discovery. Introduces the AgentFacts schema, TTL-based endpoint resolution, and cryptographic verification for agent capabilities. Offers concrete mechanisms for multi-endpoint routing, least-disclosure queries, and rapid revocation in decentralized agent ecosystems.

**[Upgrade or Switch – The Need for New Registry](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12003)** - Analyzes the limitations of DNS and web infrastructure for AI agent systems. Weighs incremental upgrades (e.g., DNS push, SVCB records) against purpose-built registries. Offers analogies like dial-up to broadband and outlines the technical deltas introduced by the agent paradigm.

**[NANDA Adaptive Resolver: Architecture for Dynamic Resolution of AI Agent Names](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03113)** - AdaptiveResolver is a dynamic microservice architecture designed to address the limitations of static endpoint resolution for AI agent communication in distributed, heterogeneous environments. [![arXiv](https://img.shields.io/badge/arXiv-2508.03113-00ff00.svg)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03113)    

**[Using the NANDA Index Architecture in Practice: An Enterprise Perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03101)** - Presents the NANDA framework for secure AI agent ecosystems and cross-protocol interoperability, and explores enterprise use cases. Introduces Zero Trust Agentic Access (ZTAA) and Agent Visibility & Control (AVC) for enterprise governance of autonomous agent collaboration.  [![arXiv](https://img.shields.io/badge/arXiv-2508.03101-00ff00.svg)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03101)

**[Survey of AI Agent Registry Solutions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03095)** - Compares leading registry architectures - MCP, A2A, Microsoft Entra Agent ID, and NANDA, across security, scalability, authentication, and maintainability. Highlights NANDA’s AgentFacts as a privacy-preserving, cryptographically verifiable schema purpose-built for dynamic, multi-agent systems.
