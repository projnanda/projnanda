# Project NANDA: Building the Agentic Web

How can trillions of  AI agents collaborate across a organizational silos: communicate seamlessly, navigate autonomously, socialize, learn, earn and transact on our behalf. Project NANDA is building a quilt for a new kind of internet i.e. **Agentic Web**. 

NANDA, created at MIT, provides the index of federated agent registries, communication interface, and open-source tooling needed to enable this system in a decentralized, protocol-neutral way.

**Overview**

Project Nanda roadmap includes many research and implementation problems: agent discovery, Packet Switched Intelligence, trust, privateML, knowledge pricing, population AI and more. In the short term, NANDA defines a minimal set of abstractions to:

- **Identify** agents across the open web
- **Describe** agents with structured facts and capabilities  
- **Enable** communication across protocol boundaries (A2A, MCP, HTTPS)
- **Deploy** agents in managed or self-hosted environments
- **Interact** with agents through open clients or UX layers (e.g. chat, workflows)

The architecture is intentionally modular and protocol-agnostic. NANDA does not define a new transport layer. Instead, it stitches together existing and emerging protocols through open registries and SDKs.
