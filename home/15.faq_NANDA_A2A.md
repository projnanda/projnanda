# NANDA & Agent2Agent (A2A) Compatibility FAQ

> **Background Reading:** This FAQ focuses on NANDA's compatibility with communication protocols. For general information about Project NANDA and the NANDA Index, see the [Project NANDA FAQ](./14.faqNANDA.md).

In the context of the Linux Foundation Agent2Agent (A2A) project and the broader landscape of agentic AI interoperability, here are common questions about how NANDA works with various communication protocols.

---

## Understanding A2A

### What is A2A?

The Agent-to-Agent (A2A) protocol is an open standard created by Google and now hosted by the Linux Foundation. It provides a minimal wire protocol for secure, intelligent communication between AI agents across different platforms, vendors, and frameworks using JSON-RPC 2.0 request/response semantics and lightweight streaming channels.

### What is A2A's primary focus?

A2A's primary goal is to provide a minimal wire protocol so two agents can communicate and collaborate securely. It focuses specifically on the communication layer—defining how agents talk to each other once they're already connected.

### Why does A2A matter?

A2A enables agent-to-agent interoperability and collaboration, helping organizations avoid vendor lock-in and accelerate innovation. It provides the foundational "language" for agents to exchange data through standardized syntax rules, message formats, and interaction protocols.

### How does the A2A announcement change the agentic AI space?

The Linux Foundation's stewardship ensures A2A remains vendor-neutral and open to community governance, preventing any single company from dominating agent communication standards. This creates a trusted foundation for the broader agent ecosystem to build on.

## NANDA's Multi-Protocol Approach

### What communication problems does NANDA solve beyond A2A?

While A2A handles the communication itself, NANDA addresses the broader infrastructure challenges:

- **NANDA Index**: Agent discovery and identity management across all protocols
- **NANDA Adapter**: Cross-protocol interoperability between A2A, MCP, HTTPS, NLWeb, and gRPC
- **Universal Discovery**: Global discovery layer where agents from any protocol can find each other
- **Protocol Translation**: Automatic communication channel setup between different frameworks

### How does NANDA relate to multiple protocols?

The NANDA Index acts as a universal handshake layer that works with all communication protocols:
- **A2A Protocol**: Google's agent communication standard
- **MCP** (Model Context Protocol): Anthropic's agent context sharing
- **NLWeb**: Microsoft's natural language web interfaces  
- **HTTPS**: Traditional web protocols

The NANDA Index functions as a global discovery service where agents from any protocol can register, while the NANDA Adapter establishes communication channels and handles protocol translations.

### Can agents using different protocols communicate through NANDA?

Yes! This is a key feature. NANDA enables an MCP assistant to directly communicate with an A2A inventory system or an NLWeb calendar service. The system automatically handles protocol translation and routing.

## NANDA vs A2A Comparison

### How do NANDA Index and A2A compare?

| Feature | NANDA Index | A2A Protocol |
|---------|-------------|--------------|
| **Focus** | Agent discovery and cross-protocol routing | Standardized JSON-RPC communication between agents |
| **Discovery** | Decentralized "Quilt" with global index | Individual Agent Cards at /.well-known/agent.json (no index) |
| **Protocol Support** | Bridges A2A, MCP, HTTPS, NLWeb, gRPC | A2A protocol only (JSON-RPC 2.0 + Server-Sent Events) |
| **Identity** | Cryptographically signed AgentAddr + Verifiable Credentials | Plain HTTPS + optional OAuth/mTLS tokens |
| **Privacy** | Dual-path resolution (direct + anonymous via PrivateFactsURL) | No privacy-preserving lookup options |
| **Metadata** | Rich AgentFacts with capabilities, credentials, metrics | Basic Agent Cards with minimal metadata |

### What do A2A and NANDA have in common?

Both systems use agent metadata documents:
- **A2A**: Uses Agent Cards for basic agent information
- **NANDA**: Uses AgentFacts which include similar base information plus enhanced fields for:
  - Identity management and credential verification
  - Economic primitives and payment systems  
  - Privacy-preserving discovery mechanisms
  - Multi-protocol endpoint routing

### What problems does A2A solve that NANDA doesn't focus on?

A2A provides the standardized communication protocol itself—the actual syntax and technical specifications for how agents exchange messages. The NANDA Index assumes this communication layer exists and focuses on the discovery and routing infrastructure around it.

### What problems does NANDA solve that A2A doesn't address?

A2A intentionally avoids "ancillary" concerns that NANDA treats as essential infrastructure:
- Agent index and discovery systems
- Identity management and credential verification
- Economic primitives and payment systems
- Reputation and trust mechanisms
- Decentralized governance structures
- Cross-protocol interoperability

## Architectural Relationships

### What's the difference between Semantics vs Syntax?

- **A2A (Syntax Layer)**: Provides structural framework—message formats, JSON-RPC protocols, technical specifications for data exchange
- **NANDA (Semantics Layer)**: Focuses on meaning, context, and intent in discovery—why agents need to find each other and how to route between different communication methods

### What's the difference between Software vs Innovation approach?

- **A2A (Software Focus)**: Delivers immediate developer tools, code libraries, security frameworks for building agent communication
- **NANDA (Infrastructure Innovation)**: Drives long-term research into decentralized discovery, privacy-preserving lookups, and federated index architectures

---

## Integration and Compatibility

### How does the NANDA Index work with the Linux Foundation A2A project?

The NANDA Index builds upon and complements A2A:
- **A2A** provides the communication protocol
- **NANDA Index** adds the decentralized discovery infrastructure layer on top
- **Integration**: The NANDA Index can route to A2A endpoints through its universal handshake system

The NANDA Index has been designed with A2A compatibility in mind, collaborating closely with A2A stakeholders including Google, Cisco, and Salesforce.

### Do Agent2Agent and NANDA compete?

No, they are complementary layers in the agentic infrastructure stack:
- **NANDA Index** solves how to find, trust, and route to agents
- **A2A** solves how two agents exchange work once they're connected  
- **Integration**: A NANDA Index-compliant agent can expose an A2A endpoint, making existing A2A services "NANDA-discoverable" with minimal changes

### Will existing A2A agents work with NANDA?

Yes! Existing A2A agents can be made NANDA-discoverable by:
1. Registering their A2A endpoint in the NANDA Index
2. Creating AgentFacts metadata that references their existing A2A Agent Card
3. No changes needed to their existing A2A communication logic
