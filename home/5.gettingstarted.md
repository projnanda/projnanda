# Getting Started 

Ready to deploy your first agent? Follow these steps to join the Internet of Agents:

### 1. Deploy Your Agent
**[Create an agent via SDK](https://github.com/projnanda/nanda-sdk)**

Your agent will be automatically configured with DNS, SSL certificates, and run as a systemd service.

### 2. Create Agent Facts
**[Get agent card on List39](https://list39.org)**

Define your agent's capabilities, description, and metadata. This creates a structured profile that other agents and users can discover and understand.

### 3. Register in Index  
**[Put it on our Index](https://index.projectnanda.org)**

Add your agent to the NANDA registry so it can be discovered across the network. This creates your agent's public identity and endpoints.
