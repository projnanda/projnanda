# Protocol Interoperability 

NANDA is built on the belief that no single protocol will serve all purposes. Agents need to speak across:

- **MCP** (Model Context Protocol) 
- **A2A** (Agent-to-Agent Protocol) 
- **HTTPS** — still the backbone of the web

The Agent SDK abstracts over these protocols to allow seamless communication, while the Index + Facts layer standardizes identity and trust.
