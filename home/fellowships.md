# PROJECT NANDA Ã— TRESATA - DEVELOPER FELLOWSHIP

**Build with us!**

Project NANDA is creating the discovery, trust, and economic rails for a web of interoperable AI agents. Join the founding cohort.

**Tresata** and Project NANDA will select **5 developers** for a **3-month, $15,000 fellowship** to advance the open-source mission of Project NANDA.

---

## WHAT YOU WILL BUILD

- **Protocols and reference implementations** for decentralized AI agents
- **Interoperability** across MCP, A2A, and modern agent runtimes
- **Integrations** with Tresata data infrastructure (streaming, governance, trust)
- **A capstone project** you own end to end, from design to demo

---

## WHO SHOULD APPLY

- **Strong programming skills** in Python, Go, or Rust
- **Experience** with distributed systems, streaming, or AI/ML frameworks
- **Builder mindset** with open-source track record and passion for decentralized technology

---

## WHY THIS MATTERS

- **Move beyond chatbots** to a true web of interoperable agents
- **Ship open foundations** others can adopt, extend, and trust
- **Collaborate** with NANDA researchers, Tresata engineers, and open-source leaders

## About the Fellowship

This fellowship represents a unique opportunity to contribute to the foundational infrastructure of the next generation of AI systems. Rather than building isolated chatbots, fellows will work on creating the protocols and systems that enable AI agents to discover, trust, and economically interact with each other in a decentralized web.

The program combines the research expertise of Project NANDA with Tresata's proven data infrastructure capabilities, providing fellows with both the theoretical foundation and practical tools needed to build production-ready systems.

### Key Focus Areas

**Decentralized AI Agent Protocols**
- Design and implement communication protocols for agent-to-agent interactions
- Create reference implementations that demonstrate best practices
- Ensure protocols are extensible and future-proof

**Cross-Platform Interoperability**
- Bridge existing agent frameworks (MCP, A2A, and others)
- Develop translation layers and adapters
- Standardize communication patterns across different runtimes

**Data Infrastructure Integration**
- Leverage Tresata's streaming data capabilities
- Implement governance and trust mechanisms
- Design systems for real-time data processing and validation

**Capstone Project Development**
- Own a significant project from conception to deployment
- Demonstrate practical applications of the developed protocols
- Create compelling demonstrations for the open-source community

### Fellowship Experience

Fellows will join a collaborative environment where they work alongside:
- **NANDA Researchers** - Access cutting-edge research in AI agent systems
- **Tresata Engineers** - Learn from experienced practitioners in large-scale data systems
- **Open-Source Community** - Contribute to projects that will impact the broader ecosystem

The remote-first approach ensures Fellows can contribute from anywhere in the US while maintaining strong collaboration through modern development practices and regular sync sessions.

*This fellowship is designed for developers who want to shape the future of AI agent infrastructure while building valuable open-source contributions that will benefit the entire community.*
