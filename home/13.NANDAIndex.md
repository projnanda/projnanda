## üèóÔ∏è NANDA Index Architecture Overview
The NANDA Index is the foundational component of Project NANDA's three-stage vision for building the Internet of AI Agents. Using a city analogy: if A2A protocols are the streets agents use to communicate, Project NANDA builds the entire city, and the NANDA Index serves as the address system.

#### To put NANDA Index in the context of bigger vision Project NANDA, which progresses through three technical phases:

Phase 1 - Foundations of Agentic Web: NANDA Index provides agent identity and discovery infrastructure, plus cross-platform communication protocols and interoperability standards

Phase 2 - Agentic Commerce: Knowledge pricing mechanisms, edge AI integration, economic protocols, and resource markets for agent services

Phase 3 - Society of Agents: Large Population Models (LPMs), collaborative learning systems, cross-silo coordination, and distributed AI networks

The NANDA Index enables all three stages by providing the essential discovery infrastructure that lets agents find and identify each other across the ecosystem. Howeever, it is only one part of the bigger goal of Project NANDA.

The NANDA Index is a lightweight, decentralized system that functions as the "phone book" for the Internet of AI Agents. Just as DNS maps website names to IP addresses, the NANDA Index maps agent names to their locations and capabilities, enabling billions of AI agents to discover and connect with each other across different platforms and protocols.

Think of it as a universal directory where any AI agent‚Äîwhether it's a translation assistant, a financial advisor, or a healthcare coordinator‚Äîcan register itself and be found by other agents or users who need its services.

NANDA Index is intentionally modular and protocol-agnostic, stitching together existing and emerging protocols through open registries and SDKs.

   ## üîß Technical Deep Dive

### Why Not DNS?

DNS was designed in 1983 for static web infrastructure. Here's why it falls short for AI agents:

| Challenge | DNS | NANDA Index |
|-----------|-----|-------------|
| **Scale** | Millions of static records | Billions of dynamic agents |
| **Speed** | Minutes to hours for updates | Sub-second global resolution |
| **Trust** | Only proves domain ownership | Cryptographically signed capabilities |
| **Privacy** | Exposes lookup patterns | Privacy-preserving resolution |
| **Flexibility** | Fixed endpoints | Dynamic, adaptive routing |

### The "Quilt" Architecture

NANDA supports multiple registration types in a federated "quilt":

```
@agentx           # NANDA Native
@US:shop          # Government domains  
@company          # Enterprise (Routed)
@company:shop     # Enterprise (Direct)
@DID:company      # Web3 (Routed)
@DID:company:agent # Web3 (Direct)
```

### Protocol Interoperability

NANDA bridges protocols seamlessly:
- **MCP** (Model Context Protocol)
- **A2A** (Agent-to-Agent Protocol)  
- **HTTPS** (Traditional web)
- **NLWeb** (Microsoft's natural language interfaces)
