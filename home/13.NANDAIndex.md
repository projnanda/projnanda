## 🏗️ NANDA Index Architecture Overview

**The NANDA Index is the foundational registry for the Internet of AI Agents.** Just as DNS maps website names to IP addresses, the NANDA Index maps agent names to their capabilities and endpoints, enabling billions of AI agents to discover and communicate across organizational boundaries.

### 🎯 Core Purpose

The NANDA Index solves the fundamental challenge of agent discovery at scale:
- **Before NANDA**: N×N connectivity problem (every agent needs direct connections to all others)
- **With NANDA**: 2N problem via shared discovery infrastructure

### 🏙️ The City Analogy

Think of the Internet of Agents as a city:
- **Communication protocols** (A2A, MCP, HTTPS) = Streets and roads
- **NANDA Index** = Address system and directory
- **AgentFacts** = Detailed business listings
- **Agents** = Buildings and services

### 📐 Three-Layer Architecture

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│           Agent Endpoints               │ ← Where agents actually run
│    (company APIs, services, etc.)      │
└─────────────────┬───────────────────────┘
                  │
┌─────────────────▼───────────────────────┐
│            AgentFacts                   │ ← Detailed metadata (capabilities,
│      (Rich metadata & credentials)     │   credentials, performance metrics)
└─────────────────┬───────────────────────┘
                  │
┌─────────────────▼───────────────────────┐
│            NANDA Index                  │ ← Lightweight registry
│     (≤120 bytes per record)            │   (names, URLs, signatures)
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Discovery Flow:** `AgentName → NANDA Index → AgentFacts → Agent Endpoint`

### 🌐 Project NANDA Roadmap Context

The NANDA Index enables a three-phase evolution:

| Phase | Focus | NANDA Index Role |
|-------|-------|------------------|
| **1. Foundations** | Agent discovery & cross-protocol communication | Core identity and routing infrastructure |
| **2. Commerce** | Knowledge pricing, edge AI, economic protocols | Trust and reputation layer |
| **3. Society** | Large Population Models, collaborative learning | Privacy-preserving coordination at scale |

   ## 🔧 Technical Deep Dive

### Why Not DNS?

DNS was designed in 1983 for static web infrastructure. Here's why it falls short for AI agents:

| Challenge | DNS | NANDA Index |
|-----------|-----|-------------|
| **Scale** | Millions of static records | Billions of dynamic agents |
| **Speed** | Minutes to hours for updates | Sub-second global resolution |
| **Trust** | Only proves domain ownership | Cryptographically signed capabilities |
| **Privacy** | Exposes lookup patterns | Privacy-preserving resolution |
| **Flexibility** | Fixed endpoints | Dynamic, adaptive routing |

### The "Quilt" Architecture

NANDA supports multiple registration types in a federated "quilt":

```
@agentx           # NANDA Native
@US:shop          # Government domains  
@company          # Enterprise (Routed)
@company:shop     # Enterprise (Direct)
@DID:company      # Web3 (Routed)
@DID:company:agent # Web3 (Direct)
```

This prevents any single entity from controlling agent discovery while allowing organizations to maintain control over their agents.

### Protocol Interoperability

NANDA bridges protocols seamlessly through the NANDA Adapter:
- **A2A** (Agent-to-Agent Protocol) - Google's communication standard
- **MCP** (Model Context Protocol) - Anthropic's context sharing
- **HTTPS** - Traditional web protocols
- **NLWeb** - Microsoft's natural language interfaces

**Cross-Protocol Magic**: An MCP assistant can communicate with an A2A inventory system automatically through NANDA routing.
