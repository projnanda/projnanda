# Current Reference Implementations <!--Components-->

### 1. NANDA Index
**[index.projectnanda.org](https://index.projectnanda.org)**

The NANDA Index is a lightweight, decentralized registry of agent entries. It functions similarly to DNS or ENS:

- Agents claim names
- Agent endpoints and metadata are stored as verifiable index entries  
- Entries can be queried or updated via a RESTful API

The Index is not meant to be a monopoly. It's designed to be forkable and federated. Multiple index-compatible registries can coexist.

### 2. AgentFacts
**[list39.org](https://list39.org)**

Each agent is associated with a structured set of facts-metadata that describes capabilities, provenance, uptime, hosting method, and more. These are designed to be human-readable and machine-verifiable.

Unlike traditional static schemas, AgentFacts evolve. They can contain:

- Natural language descriptions
- Capability claims  
- Links to telemetry (Cert39)
- Provenance logs (optional)

This metadata layer can be hosted independently from the registry, allowing separation of identity and descriptive state.

### 3. Agent Picker SDK
**[GitHub: NANDA SDK](https://github.com/projnanda/adapter)**

The NANDA Agent-Picker SDK is a Python tool that automates the setup of Internet of Agents servers. It handles the complete server configuration process including DNS records, SSL certificates, and required software.

It includes:

- Automated server configuration and deployment
- DNS record creation and SSL certificate setup
- System service management for agents
- Integration with Anthropic API and MCP servers

Developers can use the SDK to deploy:

- Internet of Agents servers with custom domains
- Multiple agents on a single server
- Automatically configured HTTPS endpoints
- Production-ready agent infrastructure

### 4. Join39 Agent Platform
**[join39.org](https://join39.org)**

Join39 is a comprehensive platform built on top of the NANDA index for creating and managing personal AI agents. It enables users to:

- Create and deploy personal AI agents (digital twins)
- Generate and manage agent facts and capabilities
- Upload and integrate MCP servers
- Join the decentralized agent network

Join39 helps bootstrap adoption by making agent creation accessible and streamlining network onboarding.

These platforms are maintained independently but follow the NANDA architecture, encouraging replication and decentralization.

### 5. NANDA Agent Framework
**[GitHub: NANDA Agent Framework](https://github.com/projnanda/adapter)**

Bring your agent. Make it persistent, discoverable and interoperable with NANDA.

## Features

- **Multiple AI Frameworks**: Support for LangChain, CrewAI, and any custom logic.
- **Multi-protocol Communication**: Built-in protocol that allows universal communication
- **Global Index**: Automatic agent discovery via NANDA Index
- **SSL Support**: Production-ready with Let's Encrypt certificates
