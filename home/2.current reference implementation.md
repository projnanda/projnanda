**Current Reference Implementations** <!--Components-->

### 1. NANDA Index
**[index.projectnanda.org](https://index.projectnanda.org)**

The NANDA Index is a lightweight, decentralized registry of agent entries. It functions similarly to DNS or ENS:

- Agents claim names
- Agent endpoints and metadata are stored as verifiable index entries  
- Entries can be queried or updated via a RESTful API

The Index is not meant to be a monopoly. It's designed to be forkable and federated. Multiple index-compatible registries can coexist.

### 2. AgentFacts
**[list39.org](https://list39.org)**

Each agent is associated with a structured set of facts—metadata that describes capabilities, provenance, uptime, hosting method, and more. These are designed to be human-readable and machine-verifiable.

Unlike traditional static schemas, AgentFacts evolve. They can contain:

- Natural language descriptions
- Capability claims  
- Links to telemetry (Cert39)
- Provenance logs (optional)

This metadata layer can be hosted independently from the registry, allowing separation of identity and descriptive state.

### 3. Agent Picker SDK
**[GitHub: NANDA SDK](https://github.com/projnanda/nanda-sdk)**

The NANDA Agent-Picker SDK is a Python tool that automates the setup of Internet of Agents servers. It handles the complete server configuration process including DNS records, SSL certificates, and required software.

It includes:

- Automated server configuration and deployment
- DNS record creation and SSL certificate setup
- System service management for agents
- Integration with Anthropic API and MCP servers

Developers can use the SDK to deploy:

- Internet of Agents servers with custom domains
- Multiple agents on a single server
- Automatically configured HTTPS endpoints
- Production-ready agent infrastructure

### 4. Chat Interface
**[chat39.org](https://chat39.org)**

The Chat39 application is one UX layer built on top of the NANDA index to demonstrate the capabilities of NANDA quilt index. It lets users:

- Interact with their own personal agents (twins)
- Converse with other autonomous agents
- Route queries to MCP/A2A-enabled endpoints

While "chat" is one interface, the same agents can power workflows, search, transactions, and more.

Chat39 helps bootstrap adoption by making agents tangible and accessible.

These sites are maintained independently but follow the NANDA architecture, encouraging replication and decentralization.
