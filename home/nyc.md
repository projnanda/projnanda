## Welcome to the Movement

Welcome to Project NANDA's Student Ambassador Program (NSAP) — a global movement where the next generation of innovators helps shape the foundation of the Open Agentic Web. As an ambassador, you're not just joining a research initiative; you're becoming part of an international community of student leaders building the Internet of AI Agents — an open, ethical, and decentralized future for artificial intelligence.

You'll collaborate with leading researchers, technologists, and policymakers, learning how to design technologies that are open, explainable, and human-aligned. Your role is to infuse this mission with fresh energy, curiosity, and creativity — connecting insights from classrooms, labs, and communities to the real-world architectures that will power the Agentic Web.

In the months ahead, you'll explore how AI agents can earn trust, how networks can remain open and verifiable, and how humans and machines can co-create responsibly. Each workshop, hackathon, and community event will offer you the chance to contribute to something far greater than any single system: a future where intelligence itself becomes a shared public good.

**We're thrilled to have you with us as we take on this historic challenge. Together, we're not just imagining the next Internet — we're building it.**

## About Project NANDA

Project NANDA ([projectnanda.org](https://projectnanda.org)) is a global research and innovation initiative led by Professor Ramesh Raskar (MIT) under the Foundation for Agentic Networks (FAN).

The project is building the foundational infrastructure for the **Open Agentic Web** — a new, open layer of the Internet where trillions of AI agents can safely collaborate, communicate, and transact across organizational and geographic boundaries.

### The Core Challenge

At its core, NANDA addresses a defining challenge of the AI era: **How can billions of autonomous agents discover each other, verify trust, and coordinate tasks—without bottlenecks or security vulnerabilities?**

### Our Solution

NANDA is developing both the technical infrastructure and the governance frameworks that make the Agentic Web possible, including:

- **NANDA Index** — A decentralized registry for agent discovery and verification
- **AgentFacts Layer** — Metadata schema for agent capabilities and trust
- **NANDA Adapter** — Interoperability protocols for heterogeneous agent ecosystems

Project NANDA brings together students, researchers, technologists, and policymakers to co-create the standards, infrastructure, and ethics for this next evolution of the Internet—one where humans and agents work side by side toward transparent, responsible intelligence.

## Understanding NANDA and the Agentic Web

### What is NANDA?

**NANDA** stands for **Networked AI Agents in Decentralized Architecture**. It's a global research and infrastructure initiative under the Foundation for Agentic Networks (FAN) — a non-profit organization dedicated to building the foundation for the Open Agentic Web.

If the early Internet connected computers, and the Web connected people, the **Agentic Web will connect autonomous AI agents** — intelligent software entities that can act, learn, and collaborate on behalf of humans and organizations.

### Why NANDA Matters

#### The Early Promise of the Internet
When the Internet first emerged, it carried an incredible promise: open communication, free exchange of ideas, and democratized access to knowledge.

#### The Centralization Problem
Over time, that openness began to narrow:
- A small number of companies began to control much of the world's information flow
- Algorithms optimized for engagement created echo chambers and fueled polarization
- Design patterns that kept people scrolling contributed to growing mental health issues

**NANDA exists to avoid repeating those same mistakes as we transition into the next digital era.**

### The Agentic Web: The Next Internet

The Agentic Web represents a shift from human-operated systems to networks where AI agents act on our behalf. Imagine:

- A student's AI assistant coordinating with a professor's agent to schedule meetings
- A local environmental agent analyzing pollution data and reporting it directly to a city dashboard
- Agents representing organizations negotiating contracts, managing logistics, or even co-writing research papers

These agents won't just operate within single apps or platforms; they'll move fluidly across the entire Internet. But for that to work, they need a new kind of infrastructure—something more flexible, secure, and transparent than today's systems.

**That's where NANDA comes in.**

### What NANDA Builds

#### The NANDA Index
A new kind of registry that allows AI agents to be discovered, verified, and trusted. Think of it as a **decentralized phonebook for the Agentic Web**—one that lets agents find each other, verify credentials, and exchange information safely.

Unlike centralized systems like DNS or corporate app stores, the NANDA Index is open and lightweight. It uses **AgentFacts**, a metadata schema that allows each agent to describe its capabilities, trust level, and connections in a verifiable way.

#### Decentralization and Trust
NANDA's architecture embraces decentralization to prevent control from consolidating in a few hands. Multiple organizations, developers, and communities can host their own NANDA registries, creating a network of interoperable systems rather than a single gatekeeper.

It also integrates concepts from **Zero Trust security**—every agent must verify another's identity and capabilities before interaction.

#### Interoperability Across Platforms
NANDA research shows how its system can interoperate with existing frameworks like Anthropic's MCP, Google's Agent-to-Agent (A2A), and Microsoft's NLWeb, bridging these separate ecosystems into a single, open web of agents.

## Why Youth Involvement Matters

### Learning from the Past
The story of the Internet shows us a pattern: each technological revolution begins with idealism, only to be shaped later by whoever controls its infrastructure. For the Agentic Web, we still have a choice.

If young researchers, students, and technologists don't participate now, the same pattern of consolidation could repeat—only faster and at a larger scale. **The youth of today will inherit the infrastructure of tomorrow**, so the architecture of the Agentic Web must reflect our generation's values: openness, transparency, diversity, and shared progress.

### Youth as Architects of the Future

Students are uniquely positioned to drive this movement:

- **Curiosity:** Young minds question assumptions, an essential trait for redesigning global systems
- **Diversity:** Youth bring perspectives from across cultures and disciplines, ensuring the Agentic Web reflects global needs
- **Technical fluency:** Today's students are digital natives who understand both the potential and dangers of technology
- **Personal relevance:** The youth of today will be the most impacted demographic by the formation of the Agentic Web

By joining NANDA, ambassadors become part of a movement to shape the policies, standards, and technologies that will govern AI agents for decades to come.

## The Mission Ahead

The Internet was once a place of radical openness, a network built on trust and curiosity. But over time, it became shaped by economic incentives and centralized control.

**The Agentic Web represents a second chance to get it right.** If we design its architecture carefully—building systems that are transparent, decentralized, and human-aligned—we can create a web that amplifies human creativity rather than exploits it.

For students joining the NANDA Ambassador Program, this is not just about learning technology; **it's about helping to write the next chapter of the Internet's story.** The choices we make now will determine whether the Agentic Web becomes a tool for empowerment or another system of control.
